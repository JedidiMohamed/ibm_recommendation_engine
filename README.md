# IBM Recommendation Engine
Recommendation System with IBM Watson
This project was concieved in collaboration with Udacity and IBM Watson

## Overview
In this project I aim to create a recommendation system for the IBM Watson community. The recommendation system
suggests articles for users to interact.

### Features
The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways:
1. Collaborative Filtering
> - Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users
2. Rank Based Recommendations
> - Recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked 
3. Content Based Filtering
> - Produces recommendations based on similarity to material the user has interacted with previously. Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology to analyse and rank articles by similarity.
4. SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations
> - Utilises matrix operations to predict the ranking (or in this case the boolean interaction variable)
